        <h3>Founder: Vincent Emery</h3>

        <p class="small">
          I started my career in DevOps and platform engineering, working on reliability, automation and cloud infrastructure for software teams. Over more than a decade, one pattern became clear: the biggest operational bottlenecks were never the servers — they were the manual business processes happening around the systems.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          Razorline Labs was created to solve those bottlenecks. Today, I help <strong>accounting firms and administratiekantoren</strong> automate the repetitive work inside their practice: invoice processing, reconciliations, document workflows, reporting and client onboarding. My focus is always the same — reduce manual workload, eliminate errors and make operations run smoother.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          I work as a ZZP consultant based in the Netherlands, delivering reliable, secure and tailored automations for firms that want to modernize without adding complexity. Instead of one-size-fits-all tools, I build workflows that match the way your practice already works — and support them long-term through monitoring and care plans.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          The outcome is simple: less admin, fewer mistakes and more time for clients. That’s what Razorline Labs exists for.
