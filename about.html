          <h3>Founder: Vincent Emery</h3>
          <p class="small">
            I started in DevOps and platform engineering, working on CI/CD, cloud infrastructure and reliability for software teams. Over time, it became obvious that the next step was not more tooling — it was intelligent systems layered on top of existing infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            Razorline Labs is my vehicle to focus purely on that: applied AI systems and automation architecture for organisations that care about production quality, auditability and long-term maintainability.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            I work primarily with teams in the Netherlands and EU, as a ZZP consultant. I prefer hybrid engagements where we work closely with your existing engineers rather than trying to replace them.
